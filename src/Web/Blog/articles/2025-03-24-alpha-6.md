Tempest alpha 6 is here: the last alpha release for Tempest. The next one will be beta 1, and from there on out it'll be a straight line to a stable 1.0 release! Nevertheless, this latest alpha release does bring a bunch of new features, improvements, and fixes; this time by 8 contributors in total. I'll walk you through the highlights, and share a bit more about the near future plans at the end.

```
composer require tempest/framework:1.0-alpha.6
```

## tempest/view updates

We start with tempest/view, which has gotten a lot of love this release. We've fixed a wide range of edge cases and bugs (many because we're now using PHP's built-in HTML 5 spec compliant parser), but we also added a whole range of cool new features.

### x-template

There's a new `{html}<x-template>` component which will only render its contents so that you don't have to wrap it in a div. For example, the following:

```html
<x-template :foreach="$posts as $post">
    <div>{{ $post->title }}</div>
</x-template>
```

Will be compiled to:

```html
<div>Post A</div>
<div>Post B</div>
<div>Post C</div>
```

### Dynamic $slots and $attributes

Next, view components now have direct access to `$slots` and `$attributes`, this gives a lot more flexibility to build reusable components:

```html
<x-component name="x-tabs">
    <span :foreach="$attributes['tags'] as $tag">{{ $tag }}</span>
    
    <x-codeblock :foreach="$slots as $slot">
        <h1>{{ $slot->name }}</h1>

        <h2>{{ $slot->attributes['language'] }}</h2>

        <div>{!! $slot->content !!}</div>
    </x-codeblock>
</x-component>

<x-tabs :tags="['a', 'b', 'c']">
    <x-slot name="php" language="PHP">This is the PHP tab</x-slot>
    <x-slot name="js" language="JavaScript">This is the JS tab</x-slot>
    <x-slot name="html" language="HTML">This is the HTML tab</x-slot>
</x-tabs>
```

### Attribute improvements

Then, element attributes are now more flexible. For example, the `:class` and `:style` expression attributes will be merged automatically with their normal counterpart:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500" :class="$otherClasses"></div>
```

There's support for fallthrough attributes: any `class`, `style` or `id` attribute put on a view component will be automatically placed and merged on the first child of that component:

```html
<x-component name="x-with-fallthrough-attributes">
    <div class="bar" style="text-decoration: underline;" id="original"></div>
</x-component>

<x-with-fallthrough-attributes class="foo" style="background: red;" id="overwrite"></x-with-fallthrough-attributes>

<!-- <div class="bar foo" style="text-decoration: underline; background: red;" id="overwrite"></div> -->
```

### Relative view paths

There's now support for relative view paths when returning views from controllers:

```php
use Tempest\Router\Get;
use Tempest\View\View;
use function Tempest\View;

final class BookController
{
    #[Get('/books')]
    public function index(): View
    {
        // book_index.view.php can be in the same folder as this directory
        return view('book_index.view.php');  
    }
}
```

### View processors

We've added view processors, which can add data in bulk across multiple views:

```php
use Tempest\View\View;
use Tempest\View\ViewProcessor;

final class StarCountViewProcessor implements ViewProcessor
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly Github $github,
    ) {}

    public function process(View $view): View
    {
        if (! $view instanceof WithStarCount) {
            return $view;
        }

        return $view->data(starCount: $this->github->getStarCount());
    }
}
```

### File-based view components

View components can now be discovered by file name:

```html
<!-- x-base.view.php -->

<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <x-slot/>
    </body>
</html>
```

```html
<x-base>
  Hello World!
</x-base>
```

### The x-icon components

And finally, there's a new `{html}<x-icon>` component which adds built-in support for [iconfy](https://iconify.design/) icons:

```html
<x-icon name="tabler:rss" class="shrink-0 size-4" />
```

## Primitive helpers

Enzo has made some pretty significant changes to our `arr()` and `str()` helpers: there are now two variants available: `MutableString` and `ImmutableString`, and `MutableArray` and `ImmutableArray`. The helper functions still use the immutable version by default:

```php
use function Tempest\Support\str;

$excerpt = str($content)
    ->excerpt(
        $previous->getLine() - 5,
        $previous->getLine() + 5,
        asArray: true,
    )
    ->map(function (string $line, int $number) use ($previous) {
        return sprintf(
            "%s%s | %s",
            $number === $previous->getLine() ? '> ' : '  ',
            $number,
            $line
        );
    })
    ->implode(PHP_EOL);
```

We've also made all helper functions available directly as a function:

```php
use function Tempest\Support\Arr\undot;

$data = undot([
    'author.name' => 'Brent',
    'author.email' => 'brendt@stitcher.io',
]);
```

There's also a new `IsEnumHelper` trait which adds a bunch of convenient methods for enums:

```php
use Tempest\Support\IsEnumHelper;

enum MyEnum
{
    use IsEnumHelper;

    case FOO;
    case BAR;
}

MyEnum::FOO->is(MyEnum::BAR);
MyEnum::names();

// …
```

## Mapper improvements

We've changed the API of the mapper slightly to be more consistent. `map()->with()` can now be combined both with `->to()` and `->do()`:

```php
use function Tempest\map;

map($input)->with(BookMapper::class)->to(Book::class);
map($input)->with(BookMapper::class)->do();
```

There are also two new methods to map straight to json and arrays:

```php
use function Tempest\map;

map($book)->toJson();
map($book)->toArray();
```

## Vite support

Enzo has worked hard to add Vite support, with the option to install Tailwind as well. It's as simple as running the Vite installer:

```php
~ ./tempest install vite
```

Next, add `{html}<x-vite-tags />`, in the `{html}<head>` of your template:

```html
<html lang="en" class="h-dvh flex flex-col">
  <head>
      <!-- … -->
      
      <x-vite-tags/>
  </head>
  <body>
      <x-slot/>
  </body>
</html>
```

And run your dev server:

```
~ bun run dev

{:hl-comment:# or npm run dev:}
```

Done!

## Database improvements

Vincent has simplified database configs, instead of having a single `DatabaseConfig` object with a connection, we've created a `DatabaseConfig` interface, which each driver now implements:

```php
// app/Config/database.config.php

use Tempest\Database\Config\MysqlConfig;
use function Tempest\env;

return new MysqlConfig(
    host: env('DB_HOST'),
    port: env('DB_PORT'),
    username: env('DB_USERNAME'),
    password: env('DB_PASSWORD'),
    database: env('DB_DATABASE'),
);
```

Next, Matt added support for a `#[Virtual]` property, which excludes models fields from the model query:

```php
use Tempest\Database\Virtual;
use Tempest\Database\DatabaseModel;
use Tempest\Database\IsDatabaseModel;

class Book implements DatabaseModel
{   
    use IsDatabaseModel;
    
    // …
    
    public DateTimeImmutable $publishedAt;
    
    #[Virtual]
    public DateTimeImmutable $saleExpiresAt {
        get => $this->publishedAt->add(new DateInterval('P5D'));
    }
}
```

## In closing

One last thing to mention — you might have noticed it already — we've completely redesigned the Tempest website! A big shout-out to Enzo who made a huge effort to get it ready! Of course, there a lot more changes with this release, you can check the [full changelog here](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.5).

So, what's next? There are a handful of changes to make [before beta 1](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestone/12). Once beta has been tagged, we'll go in bug hunting mode. Our hope is that enough people will give Tempest a try so that we can have a stable version ready soon. Exciting times ahead!
