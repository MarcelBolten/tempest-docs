title: Tempest in Beta
description: |
    Today marks an important milestone for Tempest: we're releasing the first beta version of our framework, one of the final steps towards a stable 1.0 release. We'll use this beta phase to fix bugs, and we're committed to not making any breaking changes anymore, apart from experimental features.

I know. I know that we can't get it perfect from the get-go. Tempest has been in the making for almost two years, talented developers have joined the community, and we've done our best to carefully think things through; but I know: it isn't perfect.

I realize this puts us in an underdog position: why would anyone want to use a framework that has fewer features and likely more bugs than other frameworks? But people do see value in Tempest. It's the only reason I decided to work on it in the first place: there is a group of people who _want_ to use it, even when they are aware of its shortcomings. There is interest in a framework that embraces modern PHP without 10 to 20 years of legacy to carry with it. Interest in a community that dares to rethink what we've gotten used to over the years. There already is a dedicated community. People already are building stuff with Tempest.

So while Tempest is the underdog, there's already enough reason for people to use it. Not in theory, but in practice.

And, I know, it's not perfect.

Getting closer to perfection requires getting more people involved. We need hackers to build websites and console applications with Tempest, we need them to run into bugs and tell us about them so that we can fix them. We need entrepreneurs to look into third-party packages, we need to learn what should be improved on our side from their experience. We need you to be involved. That's the next step for Tempest.

I can echo the opinions of many who've already tried out Tempest before: it's a really nice and clean framework to work it. You will enjoy it. I dare to say that it's the cleanest and most intuitive framework I've ever worked with. And to take the next step, you are crucial.

Our commitment to you is that we're doing all we can to make Tempest the best developer experience possible. Tempest is and must stay the framework that truly gets out of your way. You need to focus on your code, not on hand-holding and guiding the framework. We're still uncertain about a handful of features and have clearly marked them as [experimental](/main/extra-topics/roadmap), with tried and tested alternatives in place. We're committed to a period of bug fixing to make sure Tempest can be trusted when we release the 1.0 version. Several core members have real use cases for Tempest and are working hard to be able to use it in their own projects as soon as possible.

We're committed, and I hope you're intrigued to give Tempest a go.
