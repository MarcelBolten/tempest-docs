Today marks an important milestone for Tempest: we're releasing the first beta version of our framework! This first beta version is one of the final steps towards a stable 1.0 release. We'll use this time fixing bugs, and we're committed to not making any breaking changes anymore, apart from experimental features.

## The path forward

I know. I know that we can't get it perfect from the get-go. Tempest is a framework that's been in the making for almost two years, driven by a small and loyal community, we've done our best to carefully think things through; but I know: it isn't perfect.

I realize this puts us in an underdog position: why would anyone want to use a framework that has fewer features and likely more bugs than existing frameworks today? It's important to realize that I only kept working on Tempest because people already voiced their interest in it early on. Interest in a framework that embraces modern PHP without 10 to 20 years of legacy to carry with it. Interest in a community that dares to rethink what we've gotten used to over the years. There already is a dedicated community. People already are building stuff with Tempest.

But it's not perfect. 

The next step is getting more people involved in the community. We need hackers to build websites and console applications with Tempest, we need them to run into bugs and tell us about them so that we can fix them. We need entrepreneurs to look into third-party packages, we need to learn from them what should be improved on our side. We need you to be involved. That's the next step for Tempest.

I can echo the opinions of many who've already tried out Tempest before: it's a really nice and clean framework to work it. You will enjoy it. I dare to say that it's the cleanest and most intuitive framework I've ever worked with. And to take the next step, you are crucial.  

Our commitment to you is that we've done our best to really think through what we're building. We're still uncertain about a handful of features and have clearly marked them as [experimental](/main/extra-topics/roadmap). We also made sure there are alternatives for those experimental features. We're committed to a period of bug fixing to make sure Tempest can be trusted when we release the 1.0 version. Several core members have real use cases for Tempest and are working hard to be able to use it in their own projects as soon as possible.

We're committed, and I hope you're intrigued  to give Tempest a go.
